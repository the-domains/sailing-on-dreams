<p>It’s not every day that you find yourself screaming at a stranger in the middle of a bridge. She just hit me full on with her car while I was trying to cross. The sandwich shop a bit ahead seemed interesting, and I had priority. The impact dislocated my left knee. It clicked back, meaning I am standing on a painful leg.<br>“What the hell were you doing?” I ask severely agitated. “I had priority”<br>“I had to brake! You were not paying attention!” she calls back. “You should have seen that I was driving here”<br>“I saw you. I was just looking at that sandwich shop, because it seems that they have good sandwiches. You had no right to drive on. I had priority. If I’d walked thirty-three centimeters further, you’d have killed me!” This last part is bluff. I want to add some spice to the moment. I think it’s a suitable way to express my vulnerability as a pedestrian.<br>“Thirty three centimeters? Not 32 or 34?” she asks mockingly.<br>“That is not the point. The point is that you made a big mistake by entering my knee. I’m going to sue you.” To add some power to my words, I point my finger straight at her not unpleasant face. I take a step in her direction with my painful leg. She remains terribly calm.<br>“You were not paying attention to the road, drama queen. Your mind was on sandwiches. Besides, you were walking too fast.”<br>“If I was walking quickly, that was because of the appealing way in which they presented the sandwiches in that shop. I cannot help that. Just look at it.”<br>“Well, that’s right, but I’m not filling in the papers with you, and I’m certainly not letting you sue me.”<br>“You have no say in that!” I roar. “I’ll note down your licence plate number and go to the police.”<br>I stumble to the back of her car. This should shut her up.<br>“You know what, mister tall man, why don’t you go for a swim?” She grabs me by the chest, and tips my good leg out of balance. Backwards, I hobble and bobble over the street while she insists on bringing me to the fence. I realise this is not going the way I want it to when my bottom hits it. When she grabs my inner thighs, I’m shocked, when she pulls them up: astonished. That felt good for a second. Now, my centre of gravity is on a side of the fence where it should not.</p><p>My hands try to get hold of anything they can reach, but they fail. Head first, I’m speeding up towards the clear blue water under the bridge. I’ve been beaten by a girl. She managed to vanish from my life. All that stands between me and the turbulent surface is a bit of air and a second. Half a second. Clearly not enough to complete another thought. I’m above all surprised. Instinctively, I stretch my body to diving mode, and make up for a cold impact.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="38"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="40"><!-- react-empty: 41 --><!-- react-empty: 42 --><!-- react-empty: 43 --><!-- react-empty: 44 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="45"><p data-reactid="46">The doorbell makes me jump. I should lower the volume one day. One of those things I keep postponing. Standing up as slowly as I can helps me tame the excitement this bell forces upon me. It’s something I’m vaguely aware of. In the meantime, my steps show that somebody just made me rise out of my very comfortable chair. Well… as long as Ifeel in command… I open the door. It’s a girl. A woman. She is standing thirty-three centimetres from the threshold. She has natural red hair. Green eyes. Some freckles accentuate her cheeks. Pointy chin, elegant jaws. Fragile neck, I’m quite sure I could break it. A little hole between her collarbones. Her waist, her legs, her breasts. Oh, her breasts. I recognize her.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="47"><p data-reactid="48">My smile reveals my teeth. They could cut her tender skin. I imagine drinking her blood. She smiles back. Her teeth could cut mine. There’s silence. It’s filled with charge. I look into her eyes. She pierces mine. Fearless.“Hi.” she says.“Hi.” I say.Silence.“I’ve been travelling.” She says.“Have you? Where’s your luggage?”“Lost it in Paris…”“Oh… How did you find me?”“Intuition”“Intuition?”“Yes… Intuition.”“Why don’t you come in?” I ask, and step back into the house.“Thanks.” There’s surprise in her tone. I remember Nurielle from a trip I once made on Hawaii. I had felt alone for years.“Wine?”“Please”I invite her to go and sit outside in the sun. You can see it set over the fields behind my garden. They sowed wheat this year. A yellowish orange glow. She looks around.“Sit down, if you want to”Her light green dress looks gorgeous on the Bordeaux leather couch.“How’ve you been?” I ask.“Do you really want to know?” she doesn’t wait for my response “It was a terrible idea not to exchange contacts”I agree, but I strongly disagree, but she’s completely right.“Cheers! By the way”The cling of our glasses is a great reason to look deep into her eyes.“You said you lost your stuff?”Another silence.“I was robbed…”“Oh”“With a gun”“Oh…” I feel sorry that I wasn’t there to help.“He left me my documents. And my clothes”“Beautiful dress, by the way… How do you feel now?”“All I knew while it happened was that I needed to find you”Just below my belly button starts a rushing force. It burns right through my heart, swishes in my ears and shoots upwards. My mind is turbid.“Did you go to the police?”“No” another rush “I don’t trust them”The orange light of the sunset casts a sensual shade over her lips. The reflection in her eyes directs me to something inside her. It pulls my heart out through my throat. My stomach feels like a knot. I’m sure there are drops on my forehead that were not here before. I take a gulp of wine.“How did you get here?”“I asked some drivers. They were very kind.”“I can’t believe you’re here…”“Me neither” she smiles. “I never expected to see you again.” Another silence. “Not even when I rang this bell. There’s a different name on it. I just needed a place to sleep.”“Why this door?”“I know… Isn’t it scary?”“Yes… But not at all… No…”</p></div></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="56"><p data-reactid="57">I have to slow down to blow my nose.
